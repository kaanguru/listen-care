# 3. User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience for **Listen Care** will be exceptionally simple, clear, and functional. The primary goal is to provide peace of mind to the caregiver through an interface that is immediately understandable and completely reliable. Every element will be designed to reduce cognitive load, build trust, and ensure critical information (like connection status) is always evident.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Controls**: All interactions will be based on simple taps on large, clearly-labeled buttons. No complex gestures like swiping or drag-and-drop will be used.

## Core Screens and Views

1.  **Pairing Screen**: For device discovery and selection.
2.  **Guardian Dashboard**: Main screen for the caregiver showing connection status and controls.
3.  **Patient Status Screen**: Minimal screen for the monitored device showing active status and controls.
4.  **Settings Screen**: For basic configurations like noise sensitivity.

## Accessibility

Given the user base, accessibility is a priority. The design should aim for high-contrast text, very large touch targets for all buttons, and simple, clear language to ensure ease of use for everyone.

## Branding

The UI will use the following defined color palette:

- `#ffa69e` (Light Coral)
- `#faf3dd` (Ivory)
- `#b8f2e6` (Light Teal)
- `#aed9e0` (Powder Blue)
- `#5e6472` (Slate Gray)

## Target Device and Platforms

The application will target Android smartphones running Android 10 and up. For the V1, the application will be optimized for portrait mode on standard phone screen sizes. Full responsive support for tablets and landscape mode is a post-MVP consideration.
