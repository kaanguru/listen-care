- Achieve 100 active installations within the first three months post-launch.

## Background Context

**Listen Care** is an Android application designed to serve caregivers of elderly or at-risk individuals, particularly those with conditions that may prevent them from actively calling for help. The MVP is a lightweight, event-driven audio monitoring tool that operates exclusively over a local WiFi network to ensure reliability and low battery consumption. Instead of a constant stream, the 'patient' device will listen locally and only transmit audio when a sound exceeds a user-defined threshold.
